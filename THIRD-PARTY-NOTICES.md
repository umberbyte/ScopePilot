## Burp integration

PortSwigger's MCP Proxy is GPL-3.0 software. It is not included in ScopePilot's
current source tree, portable ZIP or installer. The user obtains it separately
through Burp's MCP extension and places it under the ScopePilot data directory
at `mcp/mcp-proxy-all.jar`, or points `SCOPEPILOT_BURP_PROXY_JAR` to their copy.
Its terms are separate from ScopePilot's license:
https://github.com/PortSwigger/mcp-proxy/blob/main/LICENSE

Burp Suite, its MCP extension, Node.js, Microsoft Edge, Codex CLI and Claude
Code are supplied by their respective vendors and are installed separately by
the user. Their licenses and service terms apply to their use.
